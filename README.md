#### Program Description: 

To create this project, I used the windows forms framework provided on visual studio. As an RA for SDSM&T, one challenged I was faced was creating door decs for my residents. While making these door decs, it easily became a tideous, repetative process. To tackle this, I developed this to make my door decs faster.

This program has two modes, single door dec creator and multiple door dec creator. Both modes allow the user to control the dimensions and various other image and font options (boarder thickness, font size, font type, etc...).

Where they differ is how they process names and images. While single mode allows the user to directly input the image and name, the multiple door dec is a bit more automated. The mutiple door dec takes the images from the directory and names from a spreadsheet. These names are already formated by my school's standards. 

#### Techniques/Methods Used:
 * Object oriented programming
 * Windows forms
 * File manipulation/management
 * Image creation and processing
 * Git source control
